# ADM-18-HW4-Group-11

Group 11 consisting of Michele Fortunato, Hifsa Tehreem, Michael Aichm√ºller.

The jupyter notebook `Homework_4.ipynb` shows the work in a compiled and executed form. It also shows the data scraping performed. The two python files `AdCluster.py` and `PasswordHashing.py` fill in the details for task 1 and 2 respectively, if wanted.

The scraped data used can be found in the data folder.
